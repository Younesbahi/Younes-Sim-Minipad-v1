### Younes Sim Mini Pad

A compact four-key macropad built for my sim racing rig. The layout is a straight row of switches so I can reach each control quickly while driving.

### Inspiration

I made this for my sim rig. I wanted a simple mini pad that lined up all four keys in a row so I could hit each one without taking my eyes off the screen.

### Challenges

Coding was the hardest part for me. I never worked with firmware before, so getting KMK set up and understanding how to map each key took a while. I needed some help figuring out how everything connected, but once I understood the basics it all started to make sense.
